I'm not bad. I'm just drawn that way
Be determined. Instead of intending to just try, do it
Your past experiences are valuable lessons to you now, learn from them
Just be yourself because you’re unique and you’ll shine
Life’s too short to miss out anything, try to take it slowly
You should love and take care of yourself because after all, it’s your own life
Everyone has a choice. You can choose your own path in life
There’s no perfect time for anything, do it now or you’ll regret later
Just keep going, you’ll make it one day
Never give up on your dream, fight your hardest for it
Believe in yourself. Your confidence will lead you to success and happiness
The little things you do today could make a great difference in future
Instead of seeking for happiness, live the moment and that’s where happiness exists
To be haunted by your mistakes, Buddy, that's a fate far worse than death
I am a son of Earth and Starry Heaven. I am thirsty. Please give me something to drink from the fountain of Memory
Always have hope. Be optimistic for your future
